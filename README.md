# Kotlin Android Studio Templates

## What is this?

Android Studio allows us to create custom templates. We can use this feature
to improve the experience of a developer by preventing him of writing useless
or obvious code.
With a template, you can easily implement verbose features without having to
use copy and paste. This repository contains some template in Kotlin I use to speed up my
development.

## Install

To install a template in your installation of Android Studio, copy the folder
containing the template you want to use in the following directory

```
AndroidStudioInstallationFolder/plugins/android/lib/templates/
```
Example for Windows:
```
C:/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/plugins/android/lib/templates/
```
